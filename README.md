##  :floppy_disk: INFO 6205 - Program Structure and Algorithms
Solve 3-SUM using the `Quadrithmic`, `Quadratic`, and (bonus point) `quadraticWithCalipers` approaches, as shown in skeleton code in the repository. There are hints at the end of` Lesson 2.5 Entropy`.

There are also hints in the comments of the existing code.  There are a number of unit tests which you should be able to run successfully.

Submit (in your own repository--see instructions elsewhere--include the source code and the unit tests of course):

## :bookmark_tabs: Requirements
- Evidence (screenshot) of your unit tests running (try to show the actual unit test code as well as the green strip);

- A spreadsheet showing your timing observations--using the doubling method for at least five values of N--for each of the algorithms (include cubic);

- Your brief explanation of why the quadratic method(s) work.
